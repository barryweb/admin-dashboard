# Admin Dashboard Project

An **Intermediate HTML & CSS** project focused on building a full dashboard layout using 
**CSS Grid**, nested layouts, and custom design elements. This project was completed as part of the 
curriculum and demonstrates strong understanding of grid-based page structuring, semantic HTML, 
and modern CSS practices.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to recreate (or redesign) an admin dashboard by leveraging **CSS Grid**
for all major layout structures. 
The dashboard includes:

* A **sidebar** with navigation and branding
* A **header** with search, user information, and utilities
* A **main content area** featuring:

* Project cards
* Announcements section
* Trending items area

The emphasis was placed on learning to structure a page with multiple grid containers nested inside 
one another.
